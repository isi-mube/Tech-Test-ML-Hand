## About the Project
This project started on `26/09/2023` and was completed within 2 weeks on `05/10/2023` for [AItaca Tech-Test-ML-Hand](https://aitaca.io/).

Primary Objective:
<ul>
  <li>Develop a segmentation model that removes hands from the background with high precision.</li>
</ul>

Secondary Objectives:
<ul>
  <li>Implement a web-based application using Streamlit, using user-input hand images and segmented images as the output.</li>
</ul>

## Challenges and Project Development
* Data Cleaning:
    * Created two folders named 'original' and 'no_bg'. Each hand image in these folders has a unique ID which is the original folder name appended with its index ([:10]).
    * Examined image sizes and ratios. Chose ratios [1.87, 1.85] to resize images to dimensions (2160, 4000) for the model.
    * Manually reviewed 'no_bg' images, discarding those that did not display accurate masks (like other body parts or the background).
    * The final dataset consisted of 79 unique original and 'no_bg' images. 'No_bg' images were transformed into true masks for predictions.
* Data Split:
    * Initially, the dataset was split in an 80/10/10 ratio for training, validation, and testing respectively. Used Data Augmentation to produce 3 unique new images for training.
    * For subsequent models post the MVP, adopted a 65/15/10 split. Enhanced Data Augmentation to generate 5 unique new images for training and allocated more images for validation.
* Data Augmentation:
Parameters used:
  * **Brightness Range:** 0.5, 1.5
  * **Zoom Range:** 0.2
  * **Rotation Range:** 30
  * **Width & Height shift Range:** 0.1
  * **Horizontal Flip:** True
  * **Shear Range:** 0.1
* Image Pre-Processing:
Tried multiple pre-processing techniques, unprocessed images were eventually used as they yielded better performance.
  * **Normalization:** Pixel Normalization
  * **Noise reduction:** Bilateral Filtering
  * **Histogram Equalization:** CLAHE
  * **Edge detection:** Canny Edges
  * **Morphological Operations:** Dilatation

## Notebooks
* Minimum Viable Product: [MPV](https://github.com/isi-mube/Tech-Test-ML-Hand/blob/main/02_py/01_mvp.ipynb)
* New Prototype (Explained all the Steps and cleaned MPV code): [Prototype](https://github.com/isi-mube/Tech-Test-ML-Hand/blob/main/02_py/02_prototype.ipynb)
* [Final model Eva X](https://github.com/isi-mube/Tech-Test-ML-Hand/blob/main/02_py/12_eva_X.ipynb)


## Conclusions:
* The MPV was done and finished in the first week, on `29/09/2023`, showing some promising results.
* Pre-processing the images did not improve performance.
* Succeeding models were architecturally more intricate, with a limit of 128 filters for optimum performance. Incorporating dropout and residual layers was beneficial for generating prediction masks.
* While there was an intent to experiment with various transfer learning models, time constraints prevented this. Another potential enhancement considered was using object detection before segmentation and fine-tuning some hyperparameters.
